        "# Summary\n",
        "\n",
        "Most people's computers have multiple Python versions installed (Macs come with Python pre-installed, often termed system Python). Keeping these versions (the pre-installed system Python version and other user-installed Python versions) separate and controlling them independently (e.g. installing or updating a given Python package for a specific Phython version only) requires an upfront solution. Working with virtual environments, i.e. having a separate workspace for each individual project, necessitates actively defining the Python version that will be used to create a specific virtual environment. Controlling Python versions is thus linked to the task of managing virtual environments. All packages installed in a specific virtual environment will not conflict with other virtual environments (all packages being contained in that particular workspace).\n",
        "\n",
        "Following the steps outlined here below, your computer should be in a state where different Python versions coexist peacefully and where you can safely install, upgrade, or remove libraries without affecting other projects. In fact, a working setup that is simple to maintain.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "A certainty, especially in the world of programming, is that there are numerous paths to the same destination. As a result, there is a plethora of advice available on how to arrive at a working (and hopefully maintainable) setup of a local computer to do data science using Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "Speaking from personal experience, I was always too busy doing the actual work to contemplate about the \"ideal\" setup, so I decided for the moment to ignore any best practices that might exist somewhere. Besides, given the vast amount of information available, determining the right blueprint to follow is not an easy task (just considering the combinatorial nightmare of different operating systems, python versions, installed or assumed pre-installed software, various IDEs etc etc). In short, there are many flying pieces and thus many degrees of freedom, which inevitably leads to complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, sooner or later the day always comes when you can't afford to ignore the Python setup issue any longer simply because something broke (e.g. after installing a new Python package or upgrading an installed one). From that moment on you will be busy finding a way to continue your work. Sometimes a quick fix is possible (after consulting numerous entries at Stack Overflow or similar websites), but sometimes band-aid is not enough, so that you need a fundamental solution.\n",
        "\n",
        "In order to spare you time, research effort and hopefully some nerves I will consicly summarize all steps that resulted into my tested setup. Each step builds on different sources of advice that I will cite along the way (i.e. credits, attribution and thanks are given by explicit references).\n",
        "\n",
        "::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n",
        "I used the phrase \"fundamental solution\" above for a reason: in case you got totally lost with quick fixes that resulted in even more problems later on a fresh installation of the operating system is certainly a radical approach. However, it provides a clean start from where you can begin building your new robust setup that is maintainable for all your future projects. I wrote the following lines with a fresh installation of the operating system in mind.\n",

        "I wrote this summary using macOS (version: 12.6), but you should be able to follow equivalent steps on Linux or Windows (you might need to make some modifications).\n",

        "We'll go through three main steps. The list below is intended to provide you with a high-level overview. Each of the three main steps will be explained in the following paragraphs:\n",
