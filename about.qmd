This blog reflects some of the off-springs related to my work at Delta-Science (digital research, data science & data engineering) to document selected challenges I had to resolve on the way. I am writing these pieces in the hope that this information may help others with similar challenges to find working solutions faster, making them more intelligible and reproducible.

Understanding is a constant quest and I am grateful to the crowd wisdom of diverse communities that I can tap into (crediting and thanking original contributions that I could replicate myself on the way).
