Jupyter Notebook is a tool providing exactly that. In the following lines I will briefly lead you through an exemplary setup that combines Jupyter Notebook running in a specified virtual environment with the fully open-source editor *VSCodium* (free alternative to *VS Code*). Following these lines should lead to a productive setup where you can document your data science projects in the form of a Jupyter Notebook, editing its content via the extremely capable *VSCodium* editor.\n\nBefore you proceed, please make sure that both preconditions are true:\n\n1.  your computer has a version of Python 3 installed, and\n2.  it is prepared to initialize and run a virtual environment.\n\nIn case you need help there or a refresher please take a look here: \\\n[Blog-Post-01](https://gg-delta.github.io/Delta-Science-Blog/posts/post-one/)\n\n# Overview\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1 + 1\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 2\n```\n:::\n:::\n",
